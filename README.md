We worked to design an interactive webpage that would explain Big O Notation to those with previous python knowledge. We talk about the importance of Big O Notation, how to calculate Big O, tips and tricks, each time complexity individually, and provide practice problems. We hope students at UCSD would be able to use this webpage to help them understand time complexity.
